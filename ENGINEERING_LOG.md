## 2026-11-09 — verification metrics

**Repository:** `open-agent-graph` (`rust-ai`)
**Files modified:**
- `crates/oag-graph/src/service.rs` — added `Arc<AtomicU64>` `verification_jobs` /
  `verification_failures` fields on `GraphService`; added `record_verification(bool)`.
- `crates/oag-graph/src/assert.rs` — `verify_assertion` now wraps the whole call (including the
  `Permission::GraphVerify` check) in one counted outcome.
- `crates/oag-graph/src/metrics.rs` — two new `MetricsSnapshot` fields, populated from the atoms.
- `crates/oag-graph/src/tests.rs` — new `verification_counters_count_jobs_and_failures`.
- `crates/oag-api/src/metrics.rs` — two new Prometheus lines; test fixture and expected text
  updated (14 → 16 metric lines).
- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, `spec/19-observability.md` — documented.

**Feature implemented.** `verification_jobs` / `verification_failures`, counted per
`verify_assertion` call. A rejected attempt (unknown id, missing permission) counts as a failure,
because the count is taken *after* the outcome is known.

**Why not a `COUNT(*)`.** Rejected attempts never become events, so a snapshot query returns a
permanent zero. Recorded in `RESEARCH_JOURNAL.md`.

**Tests executed.** `cargo test -p oag-graph verification_counters` (1 passed);
`cargo test -p oag-api metrics` (4 passed).

**Test results.** All passed. oag-graph total now 86 tests; oag-api 59.

**Commit:** `0a84a78` — pushed.
**Remaining defects.** None known. `blob_store_size` remains unbuilt because no blob store exists.

## 2026-11-09 — `oag ipfs pin <file>`

**Repository:** `open-agent-graph` (`rust-ai`)
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-cli/src/commands.rs`, `crates/oag-cli/src/main.rs`,
`spec/12-cli.md`.

**Feature implemented.** Pin a local file into the native IPFS node from the CLI, mirroring
`oag backup --pin`. Fails loudly when no provider is configured rather than silently doing
nothing — a pin command that appears to succeed while pinning nothing is worse than an error.

**Tests executed.** `cargo test -p oag-cli` — 20 passed (2 new: disabled-provider error,
directory/oversized rejection).

**Commit:** `bab5b74` — pushed. **Remaining defects:** none.

## 2026-11-09 — declare_alias over REST and MCP

**Repository:** `open-agent-graph` (`rust-ai`)
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-api/src/dto.rs`, `crates/oag-api/src/handlers.rs`,
`crates/oag-api/src/lib.rs`, `crates/oag-api/src/tests.rs`, `crates/oag-mcp/src/params.rs`,
`crates/oag-mcp/src/server.rs`, `crates/oag-mcp/src/tests.rs`, `docs/api.md`,
`OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

**Feature implemented.** `POST /api/v1/nodes/{id}/aliases` and the `graph_declare_alias` MCP tool,
both `graph:assert`. Deliberately REST/MCP rather than CLI: it matches the established
dispute/retract/supersede convention, and the crawler already covers the CLI use case.

**Tests executed.** oag-api and oag-mcp targeted tests; all passed. MCP total now 18.

**Commit:** `1b6863e` — pushed. **Remaining defects:** none.

## 2026-11-08 — IPFS site routes tested; spec/22 corrected

**Repository:** `open-agent-graph` (`rust-ai`)
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-api/src/ipfs_site.rs`, `crates/oag-api/src/tests.rs`,
`spec/22-future-work.md`.

**Feature implemented.** HTTP test `ipfs_site_routes_are_unauthenticated_and_inject_the_cid`.
Corrected a stale spec note claiming Phase 3 static hosting was unbuilt — it is built.

**Tests executed.** `cargo test -p oag-api ipfs_site` — passed.

**Commit:** `4ac3a57` — pushed. **Remaining defects:** none.

---

## 2026-11-08 — pad traffic reinforcement

**Repository:** `open-agent-graph` (`rust-ai`)
**Files modified:** `spec/23-tensor-pad-and-evolution-layer.md`, imagination engine.

**Feature implemented.** Recorded that traffic strengthens the tensor pad and that pads act as
data pads. See `INVENTION_REGISTER.md` OAG-INV-005.

**Commit:** `4bdef2d` — pushed.

---

## 2026-11-08 — onion rejection paths

**Repository:** `oag-mesh`
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-mesh/src/onion.rs`.

**Feature implemented.** Tests for the onion layer's rejection paths: empty path → `EmptyPath`,
key/path mismatch → `BadLength`, malformed layer (bad hex, wrong nonce length, AEAD tag failure).
Six onion tests.

**Tests executed.** `cargo test -p oag-mesh onion` — passed.

**Commit:** `0a3a61f` — pushed. **Remaining defects:** padding discipline end-to-end is unverified;
the onion chain and anonymous events are not yet composed.

---

## 2026-11-08 — cyclic route search terminates

**Repository:** `oag-mesh`
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-mesh/src/transport.rs`.

**Feature implemented.** `find_route_across_mesh_terminates_on_a_cyclic_peer_graph` (A↔B, B→C,
C→B) with a 10s timeout. Guards against an infinite loop in route search on a cyclic topology.

**Commit:** `23c8310` — pushed.

---

## 2026-11-08 — persistence temp-name uniqueness

**Repository:** `oag-mesh`
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-mesh/src/persistence.rs`.

**Feature implemented.** Each save gets a unique temp name (spec/08), removing a race where
concurrent saves could collide on a fixed temp path.

**Commit:** `be18343` — pushed.

---

## 2026-11-08 — blinded responder dispatch

**Repository:** `oag-mesh`
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-mesh/src/dispatch.rs`, `crates/oag-mesh/src/persistence.rs`.

**Feature implemented.** Filter subscription under a responder-chosen random id plus a polled
inbox; the subscription registry and inbox are persisted (spec/08, spec/14). See
`INVENTION_REGISTER.md` OAG-INV-004.

**Commits:** `0b21f3c`, `7f4d364` — pushed.

## 2026-11-08 — three-node chain, stale carrier status

**Repository:** `oag-imagination-random-data-compute`
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-imagination/src/integration.rs`, `README.md`.

**Feature implemented.** `a_request_can_travel_through_a_three_node_chain`. Corrected the README's
stale carrier status.

**Commit:** `ca94a0d` — pushed. Imagination total now 37 tests.

---

## 2026-11-08 — hardware randomness seam resolved

**Repository:** `oag-imagination-random-data-compute`
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-imagination/src/source.rs`.

**Feature implemented.** Resolved the stale `source.rs` TODO: `DeviceRandom` already implements
the seam. Added `a_device_source_reads_exactly_the_device_bytes`.

**Commit:** `0559614` — pushed.

---

## 2026-11-08 — empty-node and address-less-peer paths

**Repository:** `oag-imagination-random-data-compute`
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-imagination/src/node.rs`.

**Feature implemented.** `a_node_with_no_pad_starts_empty_and_peers_without_addresses_are_skipped`.

**Commit:** `1b037db` — pushed.

---

## 2026-11-08 — unreachable next hop degrades

**Repository:** `oag-imagination-random-data-compute`
**Files modified:** `crates/oag-imagination/src/socket.rs`.

**Feature implemented.** `an_unreachable_next_hop_still_gets_a_response_not_a_hang` — ten socket
tests. Consistent with "degrade, don't drop."

**Commit:** `898c927` — pushed.

---

## 2026-11-08 — spec/03 carrier status corrected

**Repository:** `oag-imagination-random-data-compute`
**Files modified:** `spec/03-transports.md`.

**Feature implemented.** Corrected stale text: HTTP, tunnel, and IPFS carriers are built; only the
Reticulum adapter remains a seam.

**Commit:** `5b51569` — pushed.

---

## 2026-11-09 — persistent project records created

**Repository:** `open-agent-graph` (`rust-ai`)
**Files created:** `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `RESEARCH_JOURNAL.md`, `INVENTION_REGISTER.md`,
`ENGINEERING_LOG.md`, `EXPERIMENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`.

**Note.** A first draft of `PROJECT_STATE.md` was created and then removed at the operator's
request during a context-clearing exchange. The records were recreated on the next directive
because PART XV requires them and they must live inside the authorized repositories.

**Remaining defects.** None. These files are living documents and will be appended, not rewritten.
